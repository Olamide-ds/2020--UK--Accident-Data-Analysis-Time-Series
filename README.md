🚗 Road Traffic Accident Analysis (UK 2020)

📌 Project Overview
Road traffic accidents are a major global health issue, causing over 1.2 million deaths and around 50 million injuries annually (Pawłowski et al., 2019). In the UK alone, the Department for Transport reported nearly 129,000 casualties between 2023 and 2024. This project analyzes UK road accident data from 2020, aiming to uncover hidden patterns, predict risks, and offer recommendations to improve public safety.

📊 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess government-provided accident data.

- Perform in-depth analysis and visualizations to identify risk factors.

- Apply Apriori algorithm for association rule mining.

- Forecast trends and provide insights for safer roads.

🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Focused only on records from 2020.

- Converted date fields to the UK datetime format.

- Encoded categorical variables numerically.

 - Removed invalid and missing entries (e.g., rows with -1 values).

- Maintained consistency and integrity of the dataset.

📁 Data Sources
The analysis is based on official UK Government Road Accident datasets and includes:

- Accident

- Vehicle

- Casualty

- LSOA (Lower Layer Super Output Area)
